            <div><article>I am tall and enjoying running in the park. If I had my preference, I'd prefer to play basketball, but I'm new to Chicago and haven't found a group to run with. Back in junior high, I was a left handed starter for my summer league team, but my dreams of becoming a left-handed specialist out of the bullpen were vanquished when I stopped playing basetball in high school.

            Outside of my interest in trying to run and play basketball, I have a yellow ukelele I'm learning to play. I also enjoy playing Cribbage, taking my dog out for walks, and making soup.
